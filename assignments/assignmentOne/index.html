            String Replacement
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>You need to change strings every so often</strong> so that they feel<br />
            comfortable playing and aren't rusty.
        </p>
        <p>
            To replace guitar strings, unwind them from the headstock of the guitar<br />
            and take them out of the tuning pegs. Then cut off the tops of the strings<br />
            and pull what's left of the strings through the back of the guitar.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, get your new strings and put them through the back of the guitar<br />
            so that they are all the way pulled through to the other side. <br />
            Put the new strings through the tuning pegs on the headstock but leave<br />
            2 to 3 inches of slack from the peg. This will allow you to have multiple<br />
            winds around the tuning peg allowing for better tuning stability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, bend the top of the string on the side past the tuning peg<br />
            to keep it from coming out. You can then start twisting the tuning<br />
            knob in the direction that the string winds toward the inside, <br />
            putting less un-needed stress on the strings.
        </p>

            Neck Cleaning
        </h2>
        <p>
            <strong><em>To clean the neck of a guitar,</em></strong> make sure the strings are off.<br />
            This will make the cleaning a lot easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>First</strong>, put a few drops of <em>lemon oil</em> in some spots along the fretboard<br />
            and then rub it in lightly with a microfiber cloth. This treats the<br />
            so that it looks nice, feels nice, and is healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is any real gunk stuck on the fretboard, you can apply some<br />
            pressure with the microfiber cloth with lemon oil to try and get it off.<br />
            This will make your guitar look and feel nice to play!
